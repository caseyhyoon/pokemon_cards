# Pokemon Card Pricing

### Description:
My friend bought a set of Pokemon cards and is interested in selling them at a price that would make him a profit.

### Goal:
Create a dashboard that visualizes a card's current sale price and show which cards would turn a profit.

### Solution:
* Scrape current sale prices from [the Pokemon card website](https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/product?productLineName=pokemon&page=1&view=grid) for a given card. (Obtaining direct API access is $$$)
* Clean, manipulate, calculate metrics, pass data into Looker [click here to view](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/a6a548d0-b0d8-4172-8ee7-12d20d5db04c)
